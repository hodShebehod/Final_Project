# Final_Project
With graditude to Hashem, I would like to present to you my final project called the Average App. Although the app is still in its developement stages, it features the ability to calculate the average of your entire class! You can add students names and grades to calculate the class's average.
Through more developement, we hope to actually have this app as a helper to all teachers out there with many more features, b'ezras Hashem.
Thank you, and enjoy! ü•áüëç
